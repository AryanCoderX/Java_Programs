# Java_ProgramsThis repository contains a collection of Java programs that I have written while learning, practicing, and exploring different concepts of Java. It covers a wide range of topics including the basics of Java syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as data structures and algorithms like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, searching, and sorting. You will also find programs based on recursion, backtracking, and various pattern-printing problems. The repository is organized into different folders for easy navigation and understanding. All the programs are written using Java (JDK 8+) and can be compiled and executed using any standard Java IDE such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse, or directly through the command line using javac and java commands. The purpose of this repository is to practice core programming concepts, strengthen problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and share knowledge with others who are also learning Java. Contributions are welcome—if you’d like to add your own programs, simply fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. This project is open-sourced under the MIT License, so feel free to explore, use, and contribute.
