Java Programs 🚀

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that I have written while learning, practicing, and exploring different concepts in Java. It covers a wide range of topics including the basics of Java syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms (DSA), recursion and backtracking, and pattern-based problems. The aim of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Java and improve problem-solving skills through practice.

📂 Repository Structure

The programs are organized into folders based on topics:

Basics – Java syntax, loops, conditionals, input/output

OOPs – Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation

DataStructures – Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs

Algorithms – Sorting, searching, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming

Patterns – Star patterns, number patterns, character patterns

Misc – Other interesting problems and utilities
